## About this Project

This project explores data manipulation using the bash shell. It consists of two Bash Shell scripts that are used to reveal relevant information about casino operations. In the '**Casino Loss Investigation Recreation**', the bash shell script '**A High Stakes Investigation**' recreates the processes of navigating, modifying, correlating, and analyzing raw data to gather and prepare evidence to solve a case. Likewise, the '**Dealer Finder interactive script**' is an interactive bash shell script that determines which employee was working at a specific time.

## The Narrative behind the project

Lucky Duck Casino has lost a significant amount of money on the roulette tables over the last month. The manager believes a player works with a Lucky Duck dealer to steal money at the roulette tables. The casino has a large database with data on wins and losses, player analysis, and dealer schedules. The largest losses occurred on March 10, 12, and 15. You are tasked with navigating, modifying, and analyzing these data files to gather evidence on the rogue player and dealer.

After the impressive results of the above investigation, you are tasked with creating a shell script that can easily analyze future employee schedules. They will use this to determine which employee was working at a specific time in case of future losses.

There are two scenarios:
- Casino losses investigation recreation: The first investigation.
- Dealer Finder interactive script: After the investigation task to create a script to use in case of future losses.
